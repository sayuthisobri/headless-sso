### Background

We want to avoid leaving the terminal and opening yet another tab and having to click Next next next...

### Install

```bash
go install github.com/sayuthisobri/headless-sso@latest
```

### Usage:

``` bash
aws sso login  --profile pp --no-browser | headless-sso
```


**Note:** `headless-sso` gets the AWS user credentials from a `.netrc` file with the following format:
 > machine name has to be `headless-sso`

```
machine headless-sso
login <username>
password <something-secret>
```
**Example:**
